Witcher Script Documentation
===========================

.. caution::
   This documentation is work in progress!

This is an unofficial documentation for the WitcherScript scripting language of The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. 

Witcher Script (.ws) is the primary scripting language for The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt. A very large chunk of the game's logic is written in Witcher Script. And thus can drastically change game behavior. Witcher Script is a proprietary language, very similar to https://udn.epicgames.com/Three/UnrealScriptHome.html.
